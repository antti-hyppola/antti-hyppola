## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a self-taught software developer working hard towards my first job!!

I've spent the last 6 years working in hospitality all around London and I've had a great time and learnt a lot, but now is time for a change!

My focus is on the front-end, though I have a lot of interest in the server side programming as well.
Currently I am confident in my knowledge of 
- JavaScript
- React
- Node

I am learning 
- TypeScript
- Redux
- CSS

And have some experience with
- MongoDB
- MySQL
- Bootstrap
- Firebase

Check out my [website](https://elated-ritchie-3f42d9.netlify.app/) and please get in touch if there's anything you'd like to ask me! (I'm also really into all American sports and love chatting about them!)
